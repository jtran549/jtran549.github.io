              <h5>Western and Southern Financial Group</h5>
              <p>
                My role as an IT Intern at Western and Southern Financial Group involves front and back end web application development, applying my 
                knowledge in ASP.NET MVC to implement additions and improvements to various projects
              </p>
              <h5>London Computer Systems</h5>
              <p>
                As a software development co-op at London Computer Systems, my main role was to implement additions to the company web API as well as fix bugs. 
                I frequently collaborated with others in order to improve the code while adhering to strict unit test procedures

              <h5>E-Technologies Group</h5>
              <p>
                My role at E-technologies group is primarily web development. I have worked on and designed web applications using mostly ASP.NET MVC as well as 
                ASP.NET Core with Razorpages. In tandem with these web applications, I have also used SQL database for storing data, and I have experience in 
                designing database tables with complex foreign key relationships. The language I have worked with the most is C#, but I have also worked with 
                Javascript, Javscript's Jquery library, and HTML.
