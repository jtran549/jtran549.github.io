          <h4>Bucket game</h5>
            <p>The bucket game was a group project created for the Web Game Development course at UC. It used the
              Phaser.js
              2D game framework and was coded
              in javascript. The overall game consisted of taking your character and sequentially completing three
              minigames. Each member of the group was
              responsible for a single minigame, with one person taking charge of connecting the three and creating the
              overarching game. I was tasked with creating
              the rock paper scissors minigame. The logic that I wrote for the game consisted mostly of conditional
              statements, and I used clip art images as assets for the
              game icons </p>

        <h4>Shipping cost estimator</h4>
        <p>The shipping cost estimator was a group project created for the Enterprise Application Development course. The objective of
          the course was to deliver a microservice web API in Java using the Spring Boot framework. The application utilized Maven for build 
          automation as well as Thymeleaf as a server-side template engine. 
          The project was developed over the course of the semester
          using the Agile development method, and was presented as a final project. Responsibilities were split into three roles: Backend, UI designer, and Git Master.
          I took up the role of UI designer.
