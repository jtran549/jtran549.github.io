        <p>My name is Jimmy Tran. I am currently heading into my 5th year at the University of Cincinnati majoring in
          Information Technology on the Software
          Development track. I have held positions as a software development co-op at E-technologies group and London
          Computer Systems and I am currently interning at
          Western and Southern Financial Group as an IT intern. The bulk of my expertise is with programming C# web
          applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, and I have experience
          working with lots of web APIs as well. During my co-ops, I have spent time developing small and medium scale
          internal applications meant to automate tasks and
          increase overall efficiency within the company, as well as implementing bug fixes and enhancements on large
          scale projets.
          Through my co-ops have working experience in HTML5, Javascript, CSS, and SQL. Through my cources at UC and
          miscellaneous small projects, I have experience in a
          myriad of other technologies such as Xamarin for Android development, Java Spring Boot, Phaser.js, and Linux.
